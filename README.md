<h1><b> Attendance-App </b></h1> <br>
<h3> Android Studio (Kotlin) </h3>

<body>
Problem:

As I have seen many faculty having problem in managing attendance.
So it would be very helpful if they can manage attendance easily.

Solution:
1 an application that allow to manage attendance data easily
2. Allow to search attendance data quickly.
3. Allow to share attendance data over gmail or whatsapp with other faculty.


ATTENDANCE: 
1. Support almost 100% android devices
2. All UI/UX rules followed
3. Supports all screen types
4. Does not require any permission

Mockup design is provided in pdf.

Note: you need to allow unknown sources in order to install this application.

I guarantee it won't harm your device. Because it does not require single permission.
